# USRI-CMFit
This is a PyQt5 Dependant Program for the fitting of raman spectroscopic data. 
Capable of removing the background and trimming .dat raman data. 
The Program features an 'auto fit' capability for easy fitting. 
Program intended to fit low grade carbonaceous material data. 
The fit provides the theoretical maximum temperature that the carbonaceous material has been exposed to.

For more information on the fitting process and the material studied, please check out the following reference:

This Project is apart of Western University and the Undergraduate Student Research Internship (USRI).
